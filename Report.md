## 1. Introduction

Rede Gazeta, one of the leading communication groups in Espírito Santo, faces significant challenges in pricing its advertising spaces in the radio environment. The current model shows little flexibility to accommodate seasonal variations, demand fluctuations, and external factors that directly influence inventory occupancy. This limitation can lead to revenue losses, idle media spaces, and difficulty in offering more competitive commercial conditions for different advertiser profiles.

### 1.1 Project Objective

The Dynamic Pricing with AI project, developed in partnership with Rede Gazeta, aims to create an intelligent and automated solution for dynamic pricing of advertising spaces on the group's radio stations. The proposal involves using predictive models based on machine learning to adjust advertising insertion prices in real-time, taking into account factors such as occupancy history, seasonality, projected demand, and external market variables.
With this, it is expected not only to optimize the occupancy of the advertising inventory but also to provide greater agility to the commercial team, offer more competitive conditions to advertisers, and increase Rede Gazeta's revenue. In the long term, the solution may also be integrated with other channels of the group, such as television, newspapers, and digital media, expanding the strategic impact of the proposal.

### 1.2 Problem Contextualization
Traditional pricing of media spaces at Rede Gazeta is predominantly fixed, not taking into account demand fluctuations over time, specific seasonality (such as high season on the coast or elections), or changes in advertiser behavior. This rigidity negatively impacts the profitability of the operation, as it results in idle spaces during periods of low demand and undervaluation during periods of high demand.
At the same time, there is a cultural and operational challenge: many advertisers and team members are accustomed to traditional negotiation practices and may resist the adoption of automated technologies. This resistance, coupled with the technological complexity of the proposed solution, required a period fully dedicated to a deep understanding of the business, involved users, and the commercial rules governing the current company model.

### 1.3 Approach and Methodology Used
To establish a solid foundation that would guide technical development in the following modules, Module 1 adopted an approach centered on a deep understanding of the business and its users, using the agile Scrum methodology, divided into five bi-weekly sprints. The focus was on creating strategic artifacts that would map the main variables of the problem, understand the internal processes of the company, define the involved actors, and explore the opportunities and threats of the advertising market.
Throughout the module, we held frequent discussions with a representative from the Rede Gazeta team, who provided valuable information about the current sales model and the main challenges faced by the commercial team. These meetings were crucial to ensure alignment between the solution proposal and the operational reality of the company, as well as to validate hypotheses raised during the artifact construction.
The deliverables were organized into three main axes:

**Part 1** - User Understanding: gathering of personas and antipersonas, mapping of the user journey, and construction of user stories with acceptance criteria and tests; <br>
**Part 2** - Structuring the Value Proposition: development of the Value Proposition Canvas and the Business Model Canvas, with clear definition of customer segments, channels, revenue sources, and key activities;<br>
**Part 3** - Strategic and Contextual Analyses: creation of the SWOT Matrix, Risk Matrix, CSD Matrix, PESTEL Analysis, Porter's Five Forces, as well as estimates of TAM, SAM, and SOM for the Capixaba radio market.

Although exploratory data analysis and the start of technical architecture definition were scheduled for the last sprint, these activities were replanned due to the lack of access to data during the expected period. As a result, the team opted to further deepen the strategic analyses and understanding of the business, ensuring a robust conceptual base that will support the technical development to be conducted in Module 2.

## 2. Project Planning and Structure 

### 2.1 Team and Roles

The construction of all artifacts was carried out in an integrated manner, with frequent moments of discussion, review, and alignment among the members. This collaborative stance allowed each deliverable to reflect both individual responsibility and the collective vision of the group, promoting consistency and depth in the analyses.

### 2.2 Sprint Roadmap 
The development of Module 1 was divided into five bi-weekly sprints, organized as follows:

**Sprint 1:** Definition of roles, alignment of project expectations, organization of the schedule, and initial task division.

**Sprint 2:** Construction of user profiles (personas and antipersonas), user journey, and elaboration of user stories.

**Sprint 3:** Structuring the value proposition of the solution, creation of the Business Model Canvas, and analysis of commercial rules.

**Sprint 4:** Development of market and strategic analyses (SWOT, PESTEL, CSD Matrix, Porter’s Five Forces, TAM/SAM/SOM).

**Sprint 5:** Stage dedicated to organizing technical inputs, initial planning of the solution architecture, and structuring of the final report.


Despite some scope adjustments throughout the module, the overall schedule was successfully met, maintaining the focus on delivering a set of artifacts to support the next project cycle.

### 2.3 Assumptions and Constraints 
During the planning stage, several assumptions were defined to guide strategic decisions:

Historical data on inventory occupancy and pricing would be available for analysis.
The team would have access to Rede Gazeta's commercial and technical team for continuous alignment.
The solution must comply with regulatory guidelines, especially concerning LGPD (General Data Protection Law).


Among the constraints, the following stand out:
The total time for module execution was 10 weeks, with bi-weekly sprints.
The use of data is restricted to internal company sources and public databases.
Deliverables must be validated with the advisor before implementation.
The team does not work full-time on the project, balancing deliverables with other curricular and internship activities.


### 2.4 Alignment with the Partner 
Throughout the module, the team maintained frequent contact with a representative from Rede Gazeta, which enabled a better understanding of the internal workings of the company and the challenges faced by the commercial team. These conversations provided valuable insights into the current pricing process, the internal systems in operation, and the real challenges faced in negotiating advertising spaces.
Although access to technical data has not yet been possible in this first module, the partner has shown interest in continuing to contribute to the project, especially in the more technical phases planned for the next cycles. The relationship established from the beginning proved essential to ensure alignment between what was developed by the team and the real expectations of Rede Gazeta.

## 3. Understanding the Business and Users 
Module 1 focused on deepening the understanding of the Rede Gazeta ecosystem, aiming to comprehend the different user profiles interacting with the pricing process and the challenges each faces. To achieve this, the team developed personas, antipersonas, mapped the user journey, and developed user stories based on identified pains and objectives.
This stage was crucial to ensure that the proposed solution truly aligns with the business needs, not just the technical aspects. Understanding the users provided valuable inputs for defining the value proposition, priority system features, and success criteria for the future application.
